# Roadmap
**syngen** is under active development.
Future updates might include:

## v0.2.0
- Simplex noise

## Wishlist
- Improving the distance-power model so different props, binaural instances, and reverb sends can have explicitly different gain calculations
- Allowing binaural instances to have configurable head shapes and filter frequencies
- Consider z-axis for acoustic shadow
- Adding helpers to load URLs into reusable buffers
